## About PiggyBank
PiggyBank is mobile wallet app that allows you to safely store you debit and credit cards at your best interest and keep your piggybank happy and full (pun intended) üê∑üí∞!

## App Design
PiggyBank follows a playful design that represents the happiness and joy of having a physical piggybank. Physical piggybanks are pink, cute, fun, and sturdy! When opening the app, users are welcomed with a launch screen containing PiggyBank's adorable app logo drawn by Ashley. PiggyBank uses a pink color scheme to resemble the colors of a physical piggybank. The color scheme can be accessed in the **Assets** folder of PiggyBank's Xcode project. PiggyBank also uses the CandyBeans font to achieve its fun, cute look! The CandyBeans Font is located in the **Fonts** folder or can be downloaded [here](https://www.dafont.com/candy-beans.font?back=theme).

## App Features

### Phone Number Formatting
PiggyBank's login page also formats user's phone numbers as they type it into the textfield.

### Invalid Phone Number Alert
When users mistype their phone, whether they enter accidentally hit **Get Verification Code** button by mistake or enter too many or too little digits, they are presented with an alert that have entered an invalid phone number.

### Phone Verification via OTP
When users enter a valid phone number, they are taken to a verification screen that prompts them to enter a six-digit One Time Passcode (OTP) in an OTP-style textfield. If the code is entered in correctly, they are taken to PiggyBank's home screen.

### Resending The Verification Code
If the user forgets the code that was sent to them or would like a new verification code, hitting the **Resend Verification Code** button on the verification screen will send them a new OTP.

### Invalid OTP Verification Code Alert
When users mistype their code, they are presented with an alert that have entered an invalid code, erases the invalid code, and allows them to re-enter the code.

### Account Information Display On Home Page
Once new PiggyBank users have verified their account or existing users return to the app, they are taken to a Home Page displaying their account balance.

### Account Settings Management
PiggyBank users have the ability to edit their account information in the Settings page. The Settings page allows them to:
- Edit and save their account usernames
- Logout of their account.

## Feature Implementations

PiggyBank's splash screen was created as a separate SwiftUI view called `SplashScreenView`. To prevent the splash screen from staying onscreen for a long period of time, a toggle called `splashScreenIsActive` and a `DispatchQueue` were used to display the splashscreen for 2 seconds. After 2 seconds, the login page is displayed. A code snippet of the splash screen transition is down below:

```swift
            .onAppear {
                //The splashscreen will stay onscreen for 2 seconds.
                DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2.0) {
                    withAnimation {
                        self.splashScreenIsActive = true
                    }
                }
            }
```

The dropdown menu for country code selection was created by using SwiftUI's [Picker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/picker) that selects from an array called 'countryCodes' that contains the US country code seen as the default option.

The number keypad dismissal operates on a `@FocusState` toggle `numberIsFocused` that is set to true when the user taps on the textfield to enter their phonenumber to display the number keypad. Dismissing the number keypad when pressing the **Get Verification Code** button or tapping anywhere on the app required the use of the `.onTapGesture` modifier to the app's overall view that sets `numberIsFocused` to false.

PiggyBank's "As You Type" phone number formatting was implemented through the use of the `.onChange` modifier and the **PhoneNumberKit** Swift framework. PhoneNumberKit's PartialFormatter can automatically format phone numbers. The following code snippet reassigns the `phoneNumber` variable the formatted phone number as the user types it in:

```swift 
 //Formats the phone number a user types in as (###)-###-####.
        .onChange(of: phoneNumber) {
            phoneNumber = PartialFormatter().formatPartial(phoneNumber)
        }
```
The Invalid Phone Number alert was created using an `.alert` modifier and a toggle called `invalidNumberAlert`. To display the alert, PhoneNumberKit's parser attempts to parse the phone number the user entered (as shown in the code snippet below). If the parsing fails, that triggers the `invalidNumberAlert` to be true and display the alert.

```swift
    do {
        let parsedNumber = try phoneNumberKit.parse(phoneNumber)
    } catch {
        invalidNumberAlert = true
    }
```

Sending the verification code to the entered phone number is done by an API that contains a built-in method for verification called `sendVerificationToken()`. When the user clicks the **Get Verification Code** button, a `Task` is invoked that uses async/await to determine if `sendVerificationToken()` was successful at verifying the phone number (as shown in the code snippet below). 

**Note**: The phone number must be stored in an E164 format for `sendVerificationToken()` to operate.

```swift
    Task {
        do {
            let parsedNumber = try phoneNumberKit.parse(phoneNumber)
            e164PhoneNumber = phoneNumberKit.format(parsedNumber, toType: .e164)
            let _ = try await Api.shared.sendVerificationToken(e164PhoneNumber: e164PhoneNumber)
            showVerificationView = true
        } catch  {
            invalidNumberAlert = true
        }
    }
}
```

The navigation for PiggyBank's different screens is done using SwiftUI's `NavigationStack` and `.navigationDestination` modifier that navigates to the appropriate screen based on a toggle of whether to display the new screen. This also allows user to navigate back to the Login screen from the Verifications creen if they entered a wrong phone number. The code snippet below shows an example of how PiggyBank navigates from the Login screen to the Verification screen.

```swift 
            .navigationDestination(isPresented: $showVerificationView) {
                VerificationView()
            }
```

The implementation for the OTP-style textfields uses six textfields each given their own tag. An optional `@FocusState` called `isFocusedOnField` is used to keep track of which textfield the cursor is on. To account for mistyping the verification code, in the `.onchange` modifier, there are checks to account for moving the cursor forward and backward (as shown in the code sample below). 

The cases are as follows:
- **Case 1**: If a textfield has the backspace character along with the digit the user types and the index is less than five, the cursor will move forward
- **Case 2**: If the textfield is empty and the index is not in the first position of the array storing the entered digits, before deletion, the backspace character is added and the cursor moves to the previous textfield.
- **Case 3**: When the user is done typing the code and the last textfield has a count of two to account for the backspace character and the digit, `verifyOTPCode()` is called to check if the OTP code entered is valid.

```swift
    .onChange(of: enteredDigits[index]) {
        /* When a textfield has the backspace character + the entered digit
        and the index is less than five, move to the next textfield.*/
        if enteredDigits[index].count == 2 && index < numOfOTPFields - 1 {
            isFocusedOnField = (isFocusedOnField ?? 0) + 1
          
        /* Otherwise if the textfield if empty and the index is not the first index of the array,
            before deletion, add the backspace character, delete the digit, and move back one textfield.*/
        } else if enteredDigits[index].isEmpty && index > 0 {
            enteredDigits[index] = backSpace
            isFocusedOnField = (isFocusedOnField ?? 0) - 1
        }
        
        /* When the cursor is on the last textfield and the count for the textfield is 2
        (which contains the backspace character + the entered digit), verify the code the user entered.*/
        if index == numOfOTPFields - 1 && enteredDigits[index].count == 2 {
            verifyOTPcode()
        }
}
```

Verifying the entered code uses a similar `Task` structure as validating a user's phone number using the given API method `checkVerificationToken()`. A string containing the full verification code the user entered in is passed into this method along with their phone number, toggling a boolean for navigating to the Home screen if the code was valid. A loading icon tiggered by the boolean `isLoading` appears as `checkVerificationToken()` processes the code and disappears upon the method's successful completion.

```swift
    Task {
        do {
            let _ = try await Api.shared.checkVerificationToken(e164PhoneNumber: e164PhoneNumber, code: code)
            showHomeView = true
            isLoading = false
        } catch  {
            invalidCodeAlert = true
            isLoading = false
            enteredDigits = [String](repeating: backspace, count: numOfOTPFields)
        }
    }
```
In terms of invalid verification code checking, `invalidCodeAlert` (as shown in the above code snippet) and displays a dissmable alert and erases the OTP textfield to allow the user to re-enter the code.

Resending the verification code follows the same `Task` logic as the sending the verification code. Using the async/await structure, if `sendVerificationToken()` was successful, it will send a new verification code to the entered phone number.


PiggyBank is able to navigate to the Home page for logged in users and to the Login page for new or logged out users through a view model called 'PiggyBankUser'. In the 'PiggyBankUser' view model there is a method called `saveAuthToken()` that generates a user's authentication token and saves it to disk and another method called `loadUserAuthToken()` that sets the `authToken` attribute of the view model. That `authToken` attribute is used to navigate between different screens (as shown in the code snippet below)

```swift
    /* To determine which screen to show upon app launch, check to see if an authentication token exists.
     If yes, show a loading screen that takes the user to PiggyBank's home page. Otherwise, show the splash screen
     and have the user go through the log in process.*/
    switch piggyBankUser.authToken {
    case nil:
        SplashScreen()
            .environmentObject(piggyBankUser)
    default:
            LoadingScreen()
                .environmentObject(piggyBankUser)
    }
```

When logged in users relaunch PiggyBank, a loading screen appears. The loading screen loads for the amount of time it takes to retrieve a user's authentication token before taking users to the Home screen (as shown in the code snippet below) The view model method `recordAuthTokenTime()` records the time it takes to create an authentication token and stores that time in the view model attribute `authTokenTime`. 

```swift
    /* To load the Home Page, fetch the authentication token from disk
     and show the loading screen for the amount of time it takes to generate an authentication token.*/
    func loadHomePage() {
        piggyBankUser.loadAuthTokenTimeFromDisk()
        loadingHomePage = true
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + piggyBankUser.authTokenTime) {
            loadingHomePage = false
            goToHomePage = true
        }
    }
```


Displaying the balance of a user's account is done by determining has an existing balance in their account or defaulting to $0.00 if the user does not have a registered account (as shown in the code snippet below):

```swift
    // Display the user's account balance or $0.00 if no account has been created.
    if let balance = piggyBankUser.activeUser?.accounts.first?.balanceInUsd() ?? noBalance {
        Text(String(format: "$%0.02f", balance))
            .font(.custom(appFont, size: 40.0, relativeTo: .title))
            .fontWeight(.bold)
            .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
            .foregroundColor(.black)
    }
```

Displaying if a user has an existing account on PiggyBank is determined by checking if the `activeUser.accounts` attribute of the PiggyBank view model is empty. If it is empty, that signifies that there are no active accounts and the "No Accounts Created" mesage should be displayed. Otherwise, show "$$$" if there is an existing account. The default view is an empty textfield. A switch case is used to determine the appropriate message to display (as shown in the code snippet below):

```swift
        /* Determine whether to display the appropriate method for displaying
        whether a user has an existing account.*/
        switch (noAccounts, displayEmptyTextView) {
            case (true, _):
            //If no accounts exist, regardless of displayEmptyTextView's value, display 'No accounts created'."
                Text("No accounts created")
                    .font(.custom(appFont, size: 20.0, relativeTo: .title))
                    .fontWeight(.bold)
            // If an account exists, display '$$$' to signify an existing account."
            case (false, false):
                Text("$$$")
                    .font(.custom(appFont, size: 20.0, relativeTo: .title))
                    .fontWeight(.bold)
            // Show no text as a default option before determining if an account exists.
            case (false, true):
                Text("")
        }
    }
    .onAppear {
        displayAccountExistence()
    }
    
    /* Create a user and determine if that user has any active accounts to
     toggle the appropriate booleans that show the apprioriate text indicating account existence.*/
    func displayAccountExistence() {
        Task {
            if let authToken = piggyBankUser.authToken {
                try await piggyBankUser.createUser(authToken: authToken)
                if let user = piggyBankUser.activeUser {
                    if user.accounts.isEmpty {
                        noAccounts = true
                    } else {
                        noAccounts = false
                        displayEmptyTextView = false
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

```


PiggyBank's Settings page displays a user's username and phone number that is stored in the 'name' and 'phoneNumber' attributes of the `PiggyBankUser` view model. For displaying the username, the view model method `loadUserName()` determines if users with registered accounts already have existing usernames and displays them in the username textfield of the Settings page. Otherwise, the username will be set to what the user types into the textfield (as shown in the code snippet below):
```swift
    func loadUserName() {
        /* Determine if a user with an account already has an existing username
        and set the name attribute of this view model to that existing username.
        If no existing username is on file, then set the name attribute to what they enter in Settings.*/
        if let existingUserName = self.activeUser?.accounts.first?.name {
            if !existingUserName.isEmpty {
                self.name = existingUserName
            }
        } else {
            self.name = UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "name") ?? ""
            print(loadUserNameError.message)
        }
    }
```
When the user clicks the **Save** button in the top-right corner of the Settings page, the view model method `saveNewUserName()` saves the newly entered username to disk and sets the `name` attribute of the view model to that name.

In terms of logging out of PiggyBank, when tapping the **LogOut** button in the Settings page, an alert is shown warning the user that the logout process cannot be undone and asking them if they want to proceed. If the user choses to proceed, the view model method logOut() is called which removes the username, phoneNumber, and authentication token from disk and sets all view model attributes to empty strings or nil (as shown in the code snippet below):

```swift
    func logOut() {
        /* Remove the user's authentication token, username, and phoneNumber
        from disk and set all view model attributes to empty strings or nil.*/
        UserDefaults.standard.removeObject(forKey: "authToken")
        UserDefaults.standard.removeObject(forKey: "name")
        UserDefaults.standard.removeObject(forKey: "phoneNumber")
        self.name = String()
        self.phoneNumber = String()
        self.authToken = nil
        self.activeUser = nil
    }
```
