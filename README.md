## About PiggyBank
PiggyBank is mobile wallet app that allows you to safely store you debit and credit cards at your best interest and keep your piggybank happy and full (pun intended) üê∑üí∞!

## App Design
PiggyBank follows a playful design that represents the happiness and joy of having a physical piggybank. Physical piggybanks are pink, cute, fun, and sturdy! When opening the app, users are welcomed with a launch screen containing PiggyBank's adorable app logo drawn by Ashley. PiggyBank uses a pink color scheme to resemble the colors of a physical piggybank. The color scheme can be accessed in the **Assets** folder of PiggyBank's Xcode project. PiggyBank also uses the CandyBeans font to achieve its fun, cute look! The CandyBeans Font is located in the **Fonts** folder or can be downloaded [here](https://www.dafont.com/candy-beans.font?back=theme).
